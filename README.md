## What I’ve been working on
- **Traffic Management System (TMS) Plugin** for driving sims (lane graphs, AI behaviors, scoring hooks).
- **Flight/Ship handling** pipelines (modular) and **external IG** integration (CIGI/UDP).
- **Content & tooling** for fast iteration: debugging overlays, asset ingest, and reproducible builds.

---

## Highlights
- 🧠 **AI Traffic**: Polite vs. aggressive behaviors, lane-change logic, spawn/despawn, red-light compliance.  
- 🧭 **Pipelines**: Unity ↔ Unreal experiments, IG servers, and data bridges into scoring subsystems.  
- 🛠️ **Tooling**: One-click debug views (splines/lanes), auto-junction connectors, fast bake scripts.  
- 🌊 **Domains**: Driving sims (Jakarta/Monas), flight trainers (AVPT/BVPT), ship handling experiments.

## Philosophy (short)
- **Truth over polish**: instrumentation first, UX second, glamor last.
- **Determinism**: if it can’t be measured, it can’t be improved.
- **Composability**: small parts, clear seams, no magic.

<summary><b>How I work</b> (click)</summary>

- **Think before code.** I assess the size of every task first — if the architecture isn’t built yet, I design it.  
  Scalability, modularity, and clarity always come first. Professional architecture means others can extend it without pain.  

- **Debug by narrowing, not panicking.** Bugs are normal; I isolate piece by piece until the culprit shows.  
  If it’s messy, I’ll use AI — it’s a partner, not a crutch. When it gets stuck, we collaborate and push through.  

- **Commit philosophy.** I prefer *polished drops* over tiny commits. Incremental when needed, but commits should represent a state of completion, not noise.  

- **Documentation as infrastructure.** I built a **Topology Visualizer** to map high-to-low-level connections — every module, class, and dependency.  
  Documentation isn’t just for others; it’s a mirror of the architecture itself. Doxygen + AI + topology visualization = living system docs.  

- **Architecture rules.** Modular, scalable, plug-and-play. No hard dependencies.  
  Naming doesn’t matter as much as *clarity*. Comments do.  
  Detailed comments feed Doxygen, AI assistants, and future devs.  

- **Tool-driven debugging.** When in doubt: clean the `Binaries`, `Intermediate`, and `Saved` folders, regenerate `.sln`, rebuild fresh.  
  There’s even a `.bat` for it — efficiency over ritual.  

- **Team philosophy.** Everyone here’s trying to do something exceptional.  
  “Professional” means we care about architecture, readability, and growth.  
  If you build to *expand* and not just *finish*, that’s a green flag.  

- **Definition of done.** Merged to main. Tested. Working. No ambiguity.  

> **Quote:** “Measure the architecture, understand the topology — *then* start the development.”
